## 🎯 Top Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Railway OpenAI Quota Issue
**Problem**: OpenAI API quota exceeded on Railway deployment
**Error**: `Error code: 429 - insufficient_quota`

**Solution**:
- [ ] Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
- [ ] Add $5-10 credits to OpenAI account
- [ ] Verify Railway API works:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://arxiv-paper-curator-v1-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/ask" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "What papers discuss reinforcement learning?", "top_k": 3}'
  ```

**Alternative**: Use local Ollama setup (free, no API costs)

### 2. Deploy Streamlit Frontend to Streamlit Cloud
**Goal**: Get public URL for frontend demo

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. [ ] Sign in with GitHub
3. [ ] Click "New app"
4. [ ] Configure:
   - Repository: `sudhirshivaram/arxiv-paper-curator-v1`
   - Branch: `main`

### 5. Record Demo Video
**Goal**: Video walkthrough for portfolio/interviews

**Content** (2-3 minutes):
1. Intro: "I built an AI research assistant..."
2. Architecture diagram
3. Live demo with Streamlit
4. Tech stack highlights
5. Deployment on Railway

**Upload to**: YouTube (unlisted), LinkedIn, portfolio site

## 📚 Reference Documents

All documentation is ready:

- **Interview Q&A**: `docs/INTERVIEW_QA.md`
- **Portfolio Content**: `PORTFOLIO_ENTRY.md`
- **Frontend Guide**: `FRONTEND_README.md`
- **Railway Deployment**: `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Indexing Complete**: `docs/INDEXING_COMPLETE.md`

---

## ✅ What's Already Working

- [x] 100 papers indexed to OpenSearch
- [x] PostgreSQL with paper metadata on Railway
- [x] Hybrid search (BM25 + vector)
- [x] Streamlit frontend (local)
- [x] All code committed to GitHub
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Railway deployment (except OpenAI quota)

---

## 🔗 Quick Links

**Live Services**:
- API Docs: https://arxiv-paper-curator-v1-production.up.railway.app/docs
- GitHub: https://github.com/sudhirshivaram/arxiv-paper-curator-v1
- Railway: https://railway.app

**Local Development**:
```bash
# Start API
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Start Frontend
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Test Railway API** (after adding credits):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://arxiv-paper-curator-v1-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What papers discuss reinforcement learning?", "top_k": 3}'
```

## 💡 Interview Preparation

Before interviews, review:
1. **Architecture diagram** - Understand dual-database design
2. **RAG pipeline** - Explain query → retrieval → generation flow
3. **Challenges solved** - Environment variables, deployment issues
4. **Live demo** - Have both local and Railway working

**Key talking points**:
- Full-stack AI system (frontend + backend + databases)
- Production deployed (not just local)
- Solved real deployment challenges
- Modern tech stack (RAG, vector search, LLMs)

---

## 📊 System Metrics (For Interviews)

**Current State**:
- Papers: 100
- Chunks: 100 (title + abstract)
- Vector dimensions: 1024 (Jina embeddings)
- Search: Hybrid (BM25 + vector)
- Deployment: Railway.app
- Query time: 2-5 seconds

**Tech Stack** (15+ technologies):
- Python, FastAPI, Streamlit
- PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, Redis
- Docker, Railway, GitHub
- Jina AI, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, uv

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Success Criteria

By end of tomorrow:
- [ ] Railway API working (OpenAI quota fixed)
- [ ] Streamlit deployed to cloud with public URL
- [ ] Project added to at least one portfolio platform
- [ ] Optional: Full content indexing started

**Total estimated time**: 2-3 hours
